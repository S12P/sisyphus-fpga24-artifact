WARNING: [AUTO-FREQ-SCALING-04] One or more timing paths failed timing requirements. The kernel clock ulp_ucs/aclk_kernel_00 has an original frequency equal to 220 MHz. The frequency has been automatically changed to 217.3 MHz to enable proper functionality. The clock Id is 0.
WARNING: [AUTO-FREQ-SCALING-07] One or more timing paths failed timing requirements. The system clock hbm_aclk has an original frequency equal to 450 MHz. The frequency has been automatically changed to 406.3 MHz to enable proper functionality.
