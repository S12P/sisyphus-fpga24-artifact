WARNING: [AUTO-FREQ-SCALING-04] One or more timing paths failed timing requirements. The kernel clock ulp_ucs/aclk_kernel_00 has an original frequency equal to 220 MHz. The frequency has been automatically changed to 205.5 MHz to enable proper functionality. The clock Id is 0.
ADVISORY: [AUTO-FREQ-SCALING-08] For clock hbm_aclk, the auto scaled frequency 462.1 MHz exceeds the original specified frequency. The compiler will select the original specified frequency of 450.0 MHz.
